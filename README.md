# P3R Battle Simulator
A simulator of Persona 3 Reload battles


Based off https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3230774091

This was made for a roleplay, so expect things catered towards that side of things, although it can be used outside of roleplay contexts.

Stuff like the stats for the skills have been taken from Persona 5 Royal as I didn't have access to Reload's list when I made it (and I can't bother to rewrite it all again for Reload). If you want to make it exclusively for reload feel free to fork the project :) (this also means elements like pierce slash and strike have been made into phys and gun, some 3 skills might be missing and nuke and psy are added)

Make sure all the json files are in the same folder as the .py file for it to work, also you need Python to run this if you didn't know

Stats for party members are arbitrary and not accurate, feel free to modify the JSON file yourself if you want more accuracy
